## Ad-Hoc Analysis Insights

### **Sample Business Queries Answered:**

1. **Markets where "Atliq Exclusive" operates in APAC**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(market) 
FROM dim_customer 
WHERE customer = "Atliq Exclusive" AND region = "APAC";
```

2. **Percentage increase in unique products (2021 vs. 2020)**
```sql
WITH uniqprod_2020 AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_code) AS prodcnt_2020 
  FROM fact_sales_monthly WHERE fiscal_year = 2020
), 
uniqprod_2021 AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_code) AS prodcnt_2021 
  FROM fact_sales_monthly WHERE fiscal_year = 2021
)
SELECT prodcnt_2020, prodcnt_2021, 
       ROUND(((prodcnt_2021 - prodcnt_2020)/prodcnt_2020)*100, 2) AS prodcnt_inc_pct 
FROM uniqprod_2020, uniqprod_2021;
```

3. **Top 3 products in each division with highest sold quantity (2021)**
```sql
WITH prod_sold_qty AS (
  SELECT dp.product_code, dp.product, dp.division,
         SUM(fsm.sold_quantity) AS total_sold_qty
  FROM fact_sales_monthly fsm
  JOIN dim_product dp USING (product_code)
  WHERE fsm.fiscal_year = 2021
  GROUP BY dp.product_code, dp.product, dp.division
), 
div_sold_qty_ranking AS (
  SELECT division, product_code, product, total_sold_qty,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY division ORDER BY total_sold_qty DESC) AS sold_qty_rank
  FROM prod_sold_qty
)
SELECT * FROM div_sold_qty_ranking WHERE sold_qty_rank <= 3;
```

(Include more queries as needed)

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Expand product offerings** in low-count segments (**Desktops, Networking, Storage**).
- **Negotiate better pre-invoice discounts** for high-discount customers (Flipkart, Viveks, Ezone).
- **Strengthen sales channel relationships** and implement strategic marketing campaigns.
- **Invest in R&D** to match evolving consumer demands.

This analysis provides valuable insights to help AtliQ Hardware make data-driven decisions and enhance business performance.
